[![Actions Status](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/actions) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/assemblyscript.svg?color=0074C1)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assemblyscript) [![npm@nightly](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/assemblyscript/nightly.svg?color=0074C1)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assemblyscript)

**AssemblyScript** compiles a strict subset of [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) (basically JavaScript with types) to [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org) using [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). It generates lean and mean WebAssembly modules while being just an `npm install` away.

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.assemblyscript.org) or try it out in [WebAssembly Studio](https://webassembly.studio)!

Motivation
----------

> You are now able to write WebAssembly, without learning a new language, and harness all these benefits WebAssembly might offer you. I think that is kind of powerful. [...] It [AssemblyScript] is absolutely usable, and very enjoyable! - Surma, [WebAssembly for Web Developers (Google I/O ’19)](https://youtu.be/njt-Qzw0mVY) (May 8th, 2019)

> AssemblyScript was frictionless. Not only does it allow you to use TypeScript to write WebAssembly, [...] it also produces glue-free WebAssembly modules that are very small with decent performance. – Surma, [Replacing a hot path in your app's JavaScript with WebAssembly](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/hotpath-with-wasm) (Feb 16, 2019)

> Perhaps the fundamental issue [to get a small .wasm file] is that JavaScript is the only language for which the Web runtime is a perfect fit. Close relatives that were designed to compile to it, like TypeScript, can be very efficient as well. But languages like C, C++, Rust, and so forth were not originally designed for that purpose. – Alon Zakai, [Small WebAssembly Binaries with Rust + Emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/blog/binaryen/2018/04/18/rust-emscripten.html) (Apr 18, 2018)

> JavaScript's heyday as the only browser language is over, but most web developers are used to writing JavaScript, and learning a new syntax just to get access to WebAssembly is not (always) ideal. If only there was something in to bridge the gap… – Jani Tarvainen, [TypeScript is the bridge between JavaScript and WebAssembly](https://malloc.fi/typescript-bridge-javascript-webassembly) (Feb 20, 2018)

> I do think [compiling TypeScript into WASM] is tremendously useful. It allows JavaScript developers to create WASM modules without having to learn C. – Colin Eberhardt, [Exploring different approaches to building WebAssembly modules](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/10/17/wasm-mandelbrot.html) (Oct 17, 2017)
