  Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
  under terms compatible with the above MIT license:

  The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
  src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
  under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
  included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
  the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

  Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
  Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
  Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
  Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
  Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
  Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier
  and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
  have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.

  The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright © 2008
  The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
  license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.

  The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
  Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.

  The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
  originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
  domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
  in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.

  The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
  Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.

  The BSD PRNG implementation (src/prng/random.c) and XSI search API
  (src/search/*.c) functions are Copyright © 2011 Szabolcs Nagy and
  licensed under following terms: "Permission to use, copy, modify,
  and/or distribute this code for any purpose with or without fee is
  hereby granted. There is no warranty."

  The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
  the standard MIT terms.

  The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
  Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
  by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
  integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.

  The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
  licensed under the standard MIT terms.

  The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
  and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
  under the standard MIT terms.

  All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
  produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
  by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
  contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
  can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
  omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
  interest of source tree size.

  In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
  (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
  applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
  the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
  license, and to use these files without any requirement of
  attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:

  Bobby Bingham
  John Spencer
  Nicholas J. Kain
  Rich Felker
  Richard Pennington
  Stefan Kristiansson
  Szabolcs Nagy

  all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.

  This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
  the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
  to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
  negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
  permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
  obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.
